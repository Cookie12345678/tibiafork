<p>When following the magic web, I stumbled upon these formulae in Drefia that lands on a 'gate' - In a great stoke of coincidence, these were brought to my attention by Besd Tesd as I was analyzing pieces of the map-puzzle.</p>

    (<span class="hljs-name">p2</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, so in essence, we have three formula that are kinda similar to what we see earlier</p>
<ol>
<li>Area of a triangle (Tridiag(onal matrix) formula?) Tiriagonal matrixes are commonly used to create triangles.</li>
<li>Dot product of two vectors could look like this (4,3,1,5,3).(3,4,7,8,4) = 88... And the dot product is used to calculate the area of a parallelogram...</li>
<li>We have points in a two-dimensional space, just like the Dianscher coordinates.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: g stands for gate, g [a_,x_] for the <strong>coordinates</strong> of the gate in the <strong>2-dimensional-area</strong> and e for the strengh of the magic energy that flows into this gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spidey senses were too much at this point - considering the brief explanations of the formulae found in both Drefia and Demona...</p>
<p>But okay, we have some hints towards an area of a triangle.<br>
On a <em>two dimensional matrix</em> we could calculate an <em>area</em> if we had <em>three points</em>, as many corners there are in a triangle.</p>
<p>The Dianscher coordinates p3,q9,0o and p3,23,0t. are three points each.<br>
--------------------------------------1--2--3 ---------1--2--3</p>
<p>But you remember we couldn't get the coordinates to fit, let alone 3.<br>
So I had some hope but it felt like complete madness.<br>
I tried for some odd 6 hours before I could join several clues into something that actually could make sense but still borderline insanity.<br>
I created maps and wrote and plotted and thought, walked in circles, thought some more and plotted until iteration 20 when all most pieces and formulae came together into a reasonable system.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/765cbbb582044c189fc76da3867ff0df.png" alt="263b6486ea3803ae304c8e9bf97781e5.png"></p>
<p>The map looks creased in the upper right corner, so I mirrored it ;).<br>
And would you look at that, it goes all the way to Z and both sets of coordinates make a perfect triangle in the same area. Isn't that incredible.</p>
<p>A refined, maybe correct version:</p>
<p><img src="_resources/50efaf690b8343c5b0b1f12a9e8689bf.png" alt="03f9bef13321783c293ab2218104fd83.png"></p>
<h3 id="p3q90o-and-p3230t">p3,q9,0o and p3,23,0t</h3>
<ul>
<li>P3 is like we saw in the third formula, so first coordinate is P3, <strong>x</strong> → so 3 steps east from (P,P).</li>
<li>Q9 is then not the x direction but the <strong>y</strong> ↑ direction, nine steps north of (Q,Q).</li>
<li>This follows the rule of vectors we saw in formula 3 earlier, x then y ( → then ↑ )</li>
<li>0t could mean theta or gamma, there is another coordinate where the number is on the left side - and that number is also the last number of the coordinate set (0o = (O,O)?). but is that all it means? are they angles? or are they points?  the angle between 0o and 0t is 45 degrees.</li>
<li>23 Fits great if it's (23,23) where the number is counted without using the alphabet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now funny thoughts such as triangle of terror, triangle tower starts to become a bit suspicious and my sanity is slowly getting a bit better.</p>
<p>My doubts vanished when I noticed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coordinates for the <strong>area around</strong> Dianscher<br>
Written by Mathemicus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's even written by the same guy that wrote the book on honeminas formula!</p>
<p>Ok, we are definitely onto something Knightmare made and really really wanted to hide.<br>
Maybe the coordinates could be used somehow to even decipher 469.</p>
<p>Now, I felt I had to construct the Magic Web and check every spot on the map and try to understand what it could possibly mean and what the heck they could possibly try to tell us and what the heck we could possibly learn from this. Just because I kinda miss the state of complete madness.</p>
<p>To add some extra spice to the madness, we can figure out that Tibia is round.</p>

<p>See also how upper Zao is so close to Banuta, from a book found in Zao:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the year 21 of the reign of Tzuzak VII,<br>
It seemed as if the plague had clouded the minds of our people. Instead of fighting the common enemy, certain elements conspired against the king and each other. Without unified resistance of our weakened forces, the end of civilisation seemed inevitable. But some lizardmen who no longer listened to the lies of the prophets who believed in false gods started to pray for salvation. And even though they were only a few, they were heard. <strong>Our saviours came from the north</strong>. They abandoned the paradise that they had ruled to save our kin. <strong>On mighty wings</strong> they came with the north wind. Their wrath was like fire, they crushed our opponents and sowed fear into their vile hearts. They gathered our troops and led them from victory to victory. They blessed the lizards of true heart and led those lost in the darkness of lies to the light of truth. Those who refused to see the truth were eradicated by cleansing fire. ...</p>

<p>Another nice thing I came across were the ley lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player: ley<br>
Milos: Most Tibian cultures have some knowledge about those <strong>straight lines that run across the landscape</strong>, connecting both, natural and sacred sites. Some also call them <strong>‘fairy paths’ or ‘spirit lines’</strong>. …<br>
Milos: As far as I know, in Zao they are called ‘dragon lines’. <strong>Markers connecting the ley lines can be mounds, cairns, standing stones, stone circles, ponds, wells, shrines, temples or cross-roads</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's see if it holds up:</p>
<p><img src="_resources/30365055c5ba471581967c94c5f29f4c.png" alt="Magic Web 469 - Page 8 (2).png"></p>
<p>It does! We just found a lot more and the system to it.</p>
<p>Now we are going into the really spooky zone of consisteny by the content team...</p>
<p>Take your time to view this picture - In the center we have our Thais dream machine, and then in equal distances from the center we have 8 gates which are <em>particularly</em> interesting..</p>
<p><img src="_resources/6fe6e6b17cbe4c64a1770255a1f43d48.png" alt="Magic Web 469 - Page 4 (2).png"></p>
<p>And here we got loads of beds, towers, teleporters.. bonelords, stonecircles and even this map. All of the 9 gates are related to death.</p>
<p>Bounac ship, where galthen tried to discover all ancient magic..</p>
<p>There is another instance of this map in Zathroth secret library, and someone has scribbled a lot of Z on it. Crazy huh?</p>
<p><img src="_resources/dc77a8512fba4edab175af8e55682154.png" alt="4199f7a75291e0914b00ccf9dc2cf705.png"></p>
<p>Another thing I found while researching the lore of Kilmaresh, is the same map.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/0ee2e738c7f5412ab4c47a93686392b7.png" alt="Blank diagram - Page 1 (1).png"></p>
<p>We find the map in ancient ruins of Fafnar the feisty &amp; fiery sister of Suon.<br>
The explorers society representative there claims it is a map of the area Kilmaresh, so I tried it..</p>
<p><img src="_resources/02e1bb48a3b24c44a1e1ef54e3846a46.png" alt="Magic Web 469 - Page 6 (4).png"></p>
<p><img src="_resources/38c46a893f5a427394b613b208720f44.png" alt="19ad1d01744e232944008a293f1da4cd.png"></p>
<p>While on the prowl for clues, I found that there is a raid happening on the X, sometimes a pirate ship has crashed there, sometimes there are just pirates there and sometimes there are no pirates there at all. This is an unannounced raid and not much info on it can be found.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/f8acdd2c110d41b3a53a9a9e1398c24f.png" alt="f23680ae823a3a19243f72262442da99.png"></p>
<p><img src="_resources/837c48e550e348e5b83241b59714c1c3.png" alt="a5f74d675e8bccac92fa4f9ba9e6aed0.png"></p>
<p>Sunken City, where Thais dream machine used to be anchored on the map.<br>
<img src="_resources/f5b46e609c364e48b7be94aa891c1fab.png" alt="e42a7267cc9fac2e52212e31ca61c987.png"></p>
<p><img src="_resources/8e31881297214ad3a33f9f564163abe9.png" alt="988238b438756a360822c66f89e2f51a.png"></p>
<p>Do you see that? Anchoring some 2 degrees northwest of the 15th latitude of Fafnar. In front of a Celestial map.</p>
<p>We are missing something key, what is 15th latitude of Fafnar?</p>
<p>I was so scared about this because it could just break this whole theory.<br>
But when thinking about it, the 'central point' in the web is too uncanny, and there's even a chest of gold on the X when the pirates have crashed...</p>
<p>And that's when it hit me, using the exact same system we had applied to eastern Thais...</p>
<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15<br>
.............................	A..B..C..D..E..Fafnar</p>
<p><img src="_resources/20d55fa18eb34003bac5cf0ff905d2bf.png" alt="Magic Web 469 - Page 6.png"></p>
<p>(degrees are still 'legal', 90 vs 45, works in a compass)</p>
<p>The pirates must've come from the nort-east considering they just visited Port hope, and they are anchoring at the only safe place to anchor.<br>
This should be the reason that some days the pirates are on land but the ship cannot be seen.<br>
It is also one of a couple of places where pirates could hide and stay safe from the winds and waves.<br>
Hiding from both ogres and minotaurs.<br>
It's the perfect spot.</p>
<p>So it seems like they made another way into 469 as the old one had been missed for so long and really difficult.</p>
<p>Now we have</p>
<ul>
<li>One map which at the time was an unique quest reward from the shrouded Demona.</li>
<li>A way of placing map-on-map on two different places in Tibia</li>
<li>At least five hints towards the map being important in closely related places</li>
<li>A reasonable system</li>
<li>Two different places using our reasonable system</li>
</ul>
<p>While it could be strange with the map working on two places, we find it is actually reasonable - 469 has been unsolved/unexplained for some 22~ years since it was added, maybe it was too difficult? And why would they make a map in 2001 just to plan to use it for Kilmaresh in 2015 which only made the discovery stronger and the rush of dopamine and confirmation had me crying tears of joy.</p>
<p>Both places being of utmost importance. Do you know what's beneath the X? A certain optiCOMPASS from Mysterious Ornate Chest quest that we all know to be the most complex quest that Cipsoft released, it took around a decade for that quest to get to the state it is in now.</p>
<p>This is when we have to back up a little bit and look at the why. Having coordinates alone won't explain everything, and now when we have so many new potential teleports where the ancients could've been, we have a crucial key that we can use to explain the missing bits required to solve the history of the ancients, and only after that - 469.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed the article so far and have not taken a break, do.<br>
Next parts are a bit more lore but I will try to not make it heavy, please be attentive and try read, think and follow along.<br>
The lore is f-ing amazing and filled with riddles, one of which was extremely tricky but the answer had me in complete disbelief.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/58e6333542844cffa8b6aff11a99d1ee.png" alt="Blank diagram - Page 3 (1).png"></p>
<p>Now we can now connect multiple places to something.. central. Let's!</p>
<h1 id="serpentine-tower">Serpentine Tower</h1>
<p><img src="_resources/9ff27bc885bb45b493418481478668f8.png" alt="194ce236f2c40750e061f2fdff964d29.png"></p>

<p>Serpentine tower is interesting to look at because it's an astrology and magic-center, which were very important to the Pharaoh.<br>
Since we've seen some indication of 469 being about astrology, it's extra exciting to revisit this tower.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/06124de459734568938a949aae598ef6.png" alt="c16b95b1b233ce2b04cee4e72da6728b.png"></p>
<p>A place which has multiple components of what we've been looking at is Draconia.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/52275623a28f4400aa1734cebc3f1d2a.png" alt="75331eb29e32578e9de46dc08769b2a0.png"></p>
<p>If you remember, Draconia is a gate. In it we find traces of what we've been looking at, bonelord shield is there and a star amulet as well. Many things we saw in Demona.</p>
<p>This book is found in the Serpentine Tower study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchpaper 56-09 A<br>
We lost <strong>three mages</strong> in our last attempt at performing a controlled demon summoning. It is still too difficult to predict in what way the fabric of time and space is affected by the breach of the sphere, and from what we have seen the backlash of nature against demonic incursion can range from a slightly offensive odour to a sizeable explosion such as the one we saw yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see three graves there!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchpaper 33-16 H<br>
The 'stoneskin' spell is still flawed. The test subjects complained about severe problems when moving, and some actually suffered from <strong>partial paralysis</strong> or even from acute petrification! However, I still believe the spell might be useful as some sort of emergency measure because I imagine that turning oneself into a statue for a while might come in handy when all other options have failed. <strong>Oddly enough it is quite simple to focus the spell into an object, preferably an amulet</strong>, so the change is still bound to an object that serves as a transmitter.</p>

<p>The rewards of the quest are quite interesting - <strong>serpent</strong> sword, <strong>stone skin</strong> amulet, is that Uth'Amon made into an ice rapier?<br>
I wonder if we need lots of energy rings to imbue a warlord sword..</p>
<p>What did the guys do other than being at a Pyramid?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchpaper 02-56 A<br>
The work on the <strong>cat-eye spell</strong> is progressing well. Soon we will be able to reproduce this spell that is used by several of the elder races. Once this has been accomplished we will finally be able to <strong>see in the dark</strong> without attracting unwanted attention. The problem is to stabilise the spell so it can be maintained during a predictable period of time. Also, <strong>the hurtful effect of sudden light to the spell caster</strong> must be palliated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchpaper 74-08 G<br>
We haven't yet managed to improve the '<strong>find person</strong>' spell. However, we are still convinced that in theory it must be capable of divulging additional information such as the experience and power of the targeted persons as well as their general physical condition and the chemical composition of their <strong>last supper</strong>. There are numerous problems, though, and it is well possible that we have to start all over again. This would mean, of course, that we would have to create some spells to obtain information by means of magic which is plain to see <strong>when you are close to the targeted person</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these spells seem to be related somehow, to see in the dark, and find targeted people.<br>
&quot;last supper&quot; is the last meal before bed, at night-time.</p>
<p>There is another book in Serpentine Tower that seems related:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Larokhon are <strong>entities made up entirely of wind and of heat</strong>. They appear to be nothing but mere blurs in the sand, and those who are unfortunate enough to see them believe their eyes just played tricks on them. But then, the Larokhon are rarely ever seen by mortals since <strong>they shun daylight</strong>. They prefer those twilight moments when there is still some warmth left from a scorching day although <strong>night</strong> has clearly fallen. This is the time when the Larokhons' move from their secret hideouts to <strong>prey on unwary dreamers that are haunted by nightmares</strong>. Their sense of smelling fear is infallible, and once they have found their prey a mere crack in a wall is large enough for them to enter. Once they are close to their victims they feast on their innermost fears, evoking images of horror and despair that are so horrible that they often cause the dreamer's death. So take this word of warning, traveller: Beware the nights that are hot and windless, for a mere breeze of hot air may cause your demise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now need to detour further and further back into the history of the ancients to find answers...<br>
Ancient Priest by Horestis can give us insight into the history of humans and ancients.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player: secrets<br>
An Ancient Priest: <strong>With the emergence of these secrets</strong>, the shamans came out of hiding and boldly rose to power. Fights ensued and only the most mighty would prevail as leaders.<br>
Player: leaders<br>
An Ancient Priest: The most powerful shaman and fighter became the chieftain and the others became priests under his rule. ...<br>
An Ancient Priest: The chieftain married only into the families of priests and soon the first dynasty emerged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting that priests were so highly regarded, just after the chieftain.  Why is Chief Grarkharonk of Troll Sabotage a 'chief' who talks about the jungle?  It's an extremely fun mystery to pursue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Ancient Priest: Then the interest in the old spirits waned and new rulers embraced <strong>more sinister secrets</strong> ...<br>
An Ancient Priest: Those were <strong>stolen and traded from the lizards</strong> and gained by bargains with the envious and reclusive scarab spirit. ...<br>
An Ancient Priest: The spirits turned more and more away from the humans and the humans turned away from the spirits. So the old pact had been broken.</p>

<p>Okay, so sinister secrets were traded and stolen from the Lizards - what might they have been?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suns and Stars, Part I<br>
It stands to reason that the stars and the suns influence the flow of magic. <strong>The astral patterns wax and wane</strong> like the tides, and it is not possible to perform certain summonings on inappropriate days, to give but one example. The study of astrology is pointing at further influences that go well beyond summoning creatures, though. For instance, <strong>the influence of the stars and the suns seems to increase with the power level of the performed incantation or ritual</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a golden gate in Chor, we find a timey sundial by a bloody ritual bench.<br>
Down the stairs is a fortified base with the many restrained hydrae.  (sorry)</p>
<p>And to this day, I still wonder how the comparably incredibly weak, invisibility-casting snake-carrying snake-charming snake-summoning magic snakemen got all those hydrae down the stairs.  Perhaps it's a matter of skill.</p>

<p>You will make me into a fine statue Ms. Medusa? If you instead make me a stone-skin amulet I might let you live!</p>
<p>In &quot;The Great Library of Tibia Dot Com&quot;, we find some cool lore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The famous knight Apoc once wrote: &quot;Demons are the most malevolent, powerful, and dangerous creatures in Tibia. In addition to their awesome physical strength, they can also use powerful spells, such as fireballs and fire fields. Especially dangerous is <strong>their gaze</strong>, which can produce <strong>beams of pure energy</strong> to annihilate their poor victims.</p>

<p>I guess their 'controlled demon summoning' and 'the hurtful effect of sudden light' when casting cat-eye spell could be combined into something <em>delightful.</em>   (sorry)</p>
<p>Speaking of snakes, it'd be crazy if we somehow didn't squeeze the Basilisk in here in some goofy way</p>
<h1 id="basilisk">Basilisk.</h1>
<p>In the libraries of Kazordoon, we can find several recounts of people who have been pwned.</p>

<p>Blinding spells burning light, stoney stuff can't really fight</p>
<p>There is this book we can find in the Isle of the Kings, written by Teruvax Tristam - a researcher, there are.. similarities.<br>
However, there is another book slamming Teruvax saying he draws conclusions based on little evidence and folktales, and the books are <em>long</em>.  I will show the consistent bits that are interesting for our pursuit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abductions by unknown magical objects (UMO) have been reported from the earliest days of mankind and even before.<br>
...<br>
The UMOs are often described as <strong>floating, colourful lights</strong> accompanied by a phenomenon that resembles a <strong>paralyse spell</strong><br>
....<br>
Considering their abilities, it is obvious that the UMOs are somehow connected to the magic forces. Furthermore, the UMOs seem to be <strong>entities</strong> rather than vehicles or something like that.<br>
...<br>
<strong>The more we ask for answers, the more silence we find</strong>. Is this evidence that infiltration is real and that the minions of the UMOs are amongst us? I think, yes it is! Be aware! <strong>Always look up to the sky when it's dark</strong>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This coincides with lightful effects of being invincible, in the dark - and of course, the stoney stuff.</p>
<p>And finally, while scouring deep down in forbidden temple, full of gold and gems, on a gate in the magic web:<br>
We find a hilarious answer, and an answer we really need to solve 469 later on.</p>

<p>It all fits if cat-eye spell is actually snake-eye spell, one of ten odd combinations, this one of utana vid and some sort of utevo  lux/foeburner spell making their eyes glow and burn.</p>
<p>And the Larokohn being some invisible humanoid, or something else?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They <strong>appear</strong> to be nothing but mere <strong>blurs</strong> in the sand</p>

<p>We can also see lots of these pyramid things that have eyes looking at every direction</p>

<p>Another book we find on the basilisk talks of an <em>old</em> man whose name is forgotten and somehow knew the secrets of the Basilisk?</p>

<p>So it seems like an abused snake that is scared of its captors. Kazordoon is full of gems, gold and ancient metals that the dwarves protect dearly - I guess digging through all of these tunnels would be easier if you have a... move earth spell!</p>

<p>Another star amulet can be found in Omrucs treasury, amongst gold nuggets that are found in Kazordoon.<br>
Omruc was the stealthy assassin that no-one ever saw coming.</p>

<p>And these similar items, deep in (move-earthed?) tunnels by mad mage.</p>
<p>As found in another book in Serpentine Tower, they must be the Shiron'Fal, legion of slaughter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Shiron'Fal was created while the god wars were most intense. It was a gathering of generals that oversaw the course of battle. Each of them a mastermind of immense power.<br>
Over the ages they worked behind the scenes and continue to recruit and muster. Their endless army is swelling and growing. They know that the god wars are not over yet and they will be prepared when the battle rages again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timeline fits, existed during the godwars.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/5ca7e3af631c4129aa5405aecffe7067.png" alt="960f19fdcea72ce4a9b1fbe291f9ad51.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They began not only to acquire new members but also <strong>powerful artifacts and minions</strong>. All the while they operated in the <strong>shadows</strong>. Making their hidden moves, <strong>manipulating people and events</strong>, taking whatever they needed to increase their power. Their agents travelled the world in <strong>many forms and disguises</strong>, looking for relics and recruits. If a target was identified, a powerful member of the Shiron'Fal made its move with deadly efficiency. What could not be taken by guile was taken by force. For the most parts of history, though, the organisation seemed more like a sleeping giant. Waking up now and then, making some devastating moves, only to vanish into obscurity once again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We saw many forms and disguises in Thais...</p>

<p>Powerful artifacts and relics?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet <strong>most about the Shiron'Fal is shrouded in mystery</strong>. Even the most basic information like a base of operation, the number of members or even the names from more than a few of them are unknown. Not even the structure of organisation is apparent, although there are strong hints that an <strong>enigmatic single entity is in lead of the legion</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's mad!</p>
<p>There is another ghost of a priest deep down in Banuta, which tells us some interesting things about what they could've stolen.</p>
<p><img src="_resources/b32d18cfd5d04139a13bb263de076047.png" alt="7d70695c02d3193f2797f9ca73ae939d.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player: <strong>egg stealers</strong><br>
Ghost Of A Priest: Creatures from beyond. Greedy and traitorous, they stole parts of the world and of life for themselves. They corrupted the world by their deceptions and stole our birthright.<br>
Player: birthright<br>
Ghost Of A Priest: We were the rulers of the world. We overlooked the world in the name of the Great Snake. The egg stealers and their creatures stole it from our claws. …<br>
Ghost Of A Priest: We have failed the Great Snake and our decline is its punishment.<br>
Player: decline<br>
Ghost Of A Priest: We were overthrown by those of who we vainly thought we could use for our advantage, even though we knew about the foulness of the false-born.<br>
Player: false-born<br>
Ghost Of A Priest: <strong>Everything that lacks scales is no true litter of the Great Snake. They are the corrupted kin of the egg stealers.</strong></p>

<p>This is where we can fit in another tricky research paper</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchpaper 44-33 C<br>
The divination spell designed to specify the gender of an <strong>unborn child</strong> has been completed successfully after several tests using other divination spells.</p>

<p>Egg = unborn child!</p>
<p>If you can change the gender of your unborn child, you could probably do lots of other weird stuff and monstrosities.<br>
<em>&lt;chough cough phoenix egg&gt;</em><br>
maybe even utevo res &quot;Morgaroth&quot; if you scream loud enough.</p>
<p>Going back to the pyramids, I dont think they could have built em themselves, Draconia alone is huge.<br>
But! This does sound like what we've read about in the first chapter.. bonelords erecting stuff and towers all over Tibia..</p>

<p>The presence of a bonelord shield in Draconia, perhaps used for communication - could indicate a close relationship between these humanoids and the bonelords..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UMOs are often described as <strong>floating, colourful lights</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean every color like the elements?<br>
Could it be bonelord eyes that can produce 'various kinds of magic'? red fire, green earth etc..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchpaper 77-04 D<br>
The 'move earth' spell seems to be ready to enter the stage of field testing. The results so far were quite convincing, and <strong>the priests were pleased</strong>. The recent studies we have carried out together have proven that <strong>we can indeed learn from each other</strong>. I must admit I would certainly like to add this useful little spell to my personal repertoire. After all, <strong>shovels and pickaxes are heavy and pretty unwieldy</strong>, and I would very much like to leave them at home. I <strong>envy the priests for the elemental powers they are wielding</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Simula: isle<br>
Robson: It seems there was once a building in the centre of the isle. The ruins are still there. <strong>Some of the pillars outside remind me of what I've seen in a bonelord hideout</strong> that we've raided when I was younger. ...<br>
Robson: <strong>The rest of the ruins here, though, does not fit into that</strong>. Either the isle has been populated by different inhabitants, or by some race that I don't know at all. ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am guessing we are right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a whole family of those Bonelords here. They do not seem to mind me..<br>
I often have strange dreams in which those creatures <strong>talk to me using their eyes</strong>. But those are only <strong>nightmares</strong> for sure.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bonelords are my only friends. They respect me. I belong to them now. In my dreams they have <strong>shown me the path</strong> to this underground base. When I sleep I can hear them whispering in my mind promises about eternal existence and immortality. My friends can feel my hunger for revenge on humanity and will supply me with the means to punish them and all living beings.<br>
Never again I will wear that fancy armor and black shall be the color of my revenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scary details in the lore pops up like this, 'shown me the <strong>path</strong> in dreams...' like it would be some coordinate system.</p>
<p>Which would also make sense that we got this hint which could be a ley line on the magic web going 45 degree angle.</p>

<p>When scouring snek lore, I came across this Ztiss, we get to talk to Ztiss once during The New Frontier while being his prisoner, and we can never return.</p>

<p>He fought and enslaved the many-eyed horrors. I think we have found the beginning, where the mad mage enslaved bonelords and learnt their magic, 469.</p>
<p>I also find it hilarious that he ascended to the clouds, just like the mad Durin.</p>
<p>He also stole the secret of steel from the evil lords of the deep and flooded their caves to drown them.<br>
I do wonder if brightsteel could be one of them?</p>

<p>With <strong>iron claw</strong>.. that's a strange way to describe it, so it was likely after he stole the secret of steel?</p>

<p>They are right on a gate of the magic web, they have dream catchers all around, and their gods are:</p>

<p>Fasuon = Fafnar Suon<br>
Uzroth 	 = Uman Zathroth<br>
Pandor the Warrior = probably Banor<br>
Krunus, a guy = Crunor</p>
<p>And sometimes, two of the old tribe 'barbarianz' mention 'kiroki', is that Kirok?</p>
<p>We can crossreference some old tomes written by faithful people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genesis I part 1: - The Awaking of the Gods<br>
In the beginning there was only a big, gaping void. It was everywhere and nowhere.</p>
<p>In this emptiness two powerful entities appeared who were eventually known as the elder gods: <strong>Fardos</strong> the Creator  and <strong>Uman Zathroth</strong> who combined in himself two unequal halves.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning there were the three that were four. They were the source. They were creation. Then the harmony was disrupted by murder and the one that was the <strong>essence of matter became the four</strong>. <strong>The six fought</strong> <strong>and the four that were the separated unity of elements were subjugated into almost nothingness</strong>. The <strong>essence of mind</strong> stolen by the greedy creators they were made tools and were abused and misused. But they will rise again when the time of ascension comes. And the <strong>traitorurs murderer</strong> will be the first to fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mysterious strange book in isle of kings fits into this - and it also tells us that someone might've disappeared due to the combined powers of the elements.. hmm! I'm not expert on this but i found it curious.<br>
Especially since Kirok is said to be a god who was created in an attempt to separate Uman and Zathroth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when the <strong>forbidden twin</strong> no longer exists,<br>
when the <strong>one-eyed king</strong> dies in fire,<br>
when the <strong>traitor meets his fate</strong>,<br>
then excalibug will be reborn in the flame of justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>V.i Part 1: The Age of Chaos</p>
<p>However, Uman's and Fardos's joint efforts did not remain entirely without consequence, for during the unsuccessful attempt to separate the double god a small part broke away from it. This tiny shard grew and expanded until it took shape and eventually became a sentient creature of its own. This was the hour <strong>Kirok the Mad</strong> was born. Owing to his peculiar ancestry this strange god has a twisted or, as some say, a schizophrenic nature. He inherited Uman's creative mind and his inquisitive nature, so that <strong>he eventually became the patron god of all those who follow the path of science and research</strong>. However, the one trait Kirok is really famous for is his <strong>twisted sense of humour. He adores bad taste and ingenious pranks</strong>, and this peculiar characteristic <strong>makes him the favourite</strong> of bards, jesters and of all other kinds of <strong>suspicious people</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would explain why Kirok the Mad (Mage) seems to have been everywhere and could contain the power of two gods - playing both sides.<br>
Perhaps he could vanish into almost nothingness and mastered the secrets to create 469? Celestial Paladin?</p>
<p>Master of all various kinds of elements? The Magnificent &amp; Illustrous Tyrant Durin?</p>
<p>Elementalist outfit, gained from parts of the mad mage and raging mage.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>... On my second day here, I found out, that this language isn't that difficult to learn. The grammar seems to be a simplified but quite usual grammar. I try to find out some of the words. One day, after killing a lion, one of the inhabitants of the town returned, telling everyone: &quot;Nag narat umog yargoth!&quot;</p>
